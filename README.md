# About
This program was written in python, HTML, and CSS, and built using the Flask framework.  Flask is a popular web application framework written in python.
This program also uses two API's, [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20Notify-red)](http://open-notify.org/) and 
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Where%20the%20ISS%20at%3F-yellow)](https://wheretheiss.at/w/developer).  'Open Notify' was used to get the latitude and longitude of the
space station as well as all the astronauts on board, while 'Where the ISS at?' was used to get the altitude and velocity.  [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Maps-red?logo=googlemaps)](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python) was also used and displays an interactive map showing the space station's current position.  The program is hosted using git and Heroku, a cloud application platform.
